                            Peter is an Irish voice actor who's fascination with the art of voice over began at a very young age. Despite living in Ireland, Peter was exposed to a lot of American and British TV growing up, which led to him imitating the accents that he heard that were different from his own, often for the entertainment of his family. Peter has always had a knack for recognizing distinct sounds and proudly proclaims that he can still recognize the film Toy Story if even a single second of that film's audio is played to him out of context. Peter's love for the art of voice over truly began, however, when one faithful Christmas day, he noticed that a character in his new video game sounded different than they had in previous titles. A google search later, and he learned that the actor who provided the character's voice had changed. From there he set out to learn all that he could about the art of voice over, the names associated with the craft, and everything in between. He has not looked back since.

                            His voice is in the mid to low range and has a youthful, energetic quality to it.

                            Warm and friendly to everyone he works with, Peter will always take direction well and deliver his work in a punctual manner while making sure it is of the best quality possible.
